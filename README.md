This is a simple LLM based bot that utilizes chat based models (provided by Ollama). Users may speak with the bot to ask what every they want,
exclusive of hateful content that may otherwise offend certain persons To summarize, this bot is capable of regarding the use of any open
source LLM to communicate and serve users. This was all achieved using ollama's API and language models.
