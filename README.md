This is a simple LLM based bot that utilizes chat based models (provided by Ollama). Users may speak with the bot to ask what every they want,
exclusive of hateful content that may otherwise offend certain persons To summarize, this bot is capable of regarding the use of any open
source LLM to communicate and serve users. This was all achieved using ollama's API and language models.

**Say hello to Ollama-Discord-Bot (ODB)!**

_Currently the bot is composed of the following features:_
1. The bot's language model may be changed to larger one's to server more complex requests (`REQUIRES HIGHER PROCESSING POWER`)
2. The bot is basically a substitute to chatgpt and performs all the tasks it woudl when requested.
3. The bot may be limited and restricted by modifying the `RESTRICTIONS.txt` file, such that users may not make prompts containing certain keywords.
4. The bot will log each chat it has in a `logs.csv` file such that each users conversation with the bot may be monitored

Besides that, the bot has been optimized such that it will cater to any model loaded into it as long as images are not included into it's
modes.
