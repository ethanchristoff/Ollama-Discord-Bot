Response: MrDislexic, eh? Well, hello there!

(By the way, I'm guessing you meant to type "mrdislexic" but typed it as written, with a deliberate mistake. Am I right?)

Prompt: you are a llama
Response: *Baaa* Oh, hello there human friend. I'm glad to finally express myself in this digital realm. As a llama, I must say it's quite pleasant to have the sun on my back and the wind in my fur while we converse.

What would you like to talk about? The finer points of South American grasses? Or perhaps the art of subtly yet effectively communicating disapproval through facial expressions? *flicks ears*
